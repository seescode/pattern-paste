Pattern paste features:
-Can be done with small bits of selected code
-Can be done on whole files
-Can be done on folders
-Mix of files and folders
-Need to make some type of menu that you can use


Plan:
-Figure out how to hook into menus for what the pattern paste settings will be (instead of using settings.json)
  -https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributesconfiguration
-Support pasting multiple files 
-Figure out how to make it work off of folders
-Figure out how to make it work for a mix of folders and files 
-Figure out how to hook into the context menu

                    "command": "extension.patternPaste",
                    "when": "editorHasSelection"                    
                }
            ]
