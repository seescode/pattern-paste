Pattern paste features:
-Can be done with small bits of selected code
-Can be done on whole files
-Can be done on folders
-Mix of files and folders
-Need to make some type of menu that you can use


Plan:
-Figure out how to make it work off of folders
    -Look into logic.ts and make sure expandFolders() works 
-Make sure the unit tests do not have any xit 
-Figure out how to make it work for a mix of folders and files 
-Figure out how to hook into the context menu

                    "when": "editorHasSelection"                    
                }
            ]

-Write good documentation
-semantic version it and put it on npm
