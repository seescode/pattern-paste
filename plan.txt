Pattern paste features:
-Can be done with small bits of selected code
-Can be done on whole files
-Can be done on folders
-Mix of files and folders
-Need to make some type of menu that you can use


Plan:
-Make a test where a folder name is like categorySomething and then it 
renames to expectedSomething
-You need to modify your tests so that it category is at least 2 syllables long
-Add a test for a 3 syllable

-Figure out how to make it work for a mix of folders and files 
-Figure out how to hook into the context menu
