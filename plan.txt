Pattern paste features:
-Can be done with small bits of selected code
-Can be done on whole files
-Can be done on folders
-Mix of files and folders
-Need to make some type of menu that you can use


Plan:
-Make sure the unit tests do not have any xit 
  -Delete the temp folder before each run of the test so that things work!
-Bug with creating new files.  It fails if an intermediary directory
is not found.  Maybe fs-extra has an option to create intermediary 
folders.
-Test cases:
  -Try a simple one level directory 
  -Try a double level directory 
  -Try a double level directory and one directory with an empty
  -Create some crazy scenario 


-Figure out how to make it work for a mix of folders and files 
-Figure out how to hook into the context menu

            "editor/context": [

                    "command": "extension.patternPaste",
                    "when": "editorHasSelection"                    
                }
            ]  
-Figure out how to hook into keyboard shortcuts
-Bug where the name of the project also gets replaced in the big find and replace. 
-Write good documentation
-semantic version it and put it on npm 
-Setup github contribution file
